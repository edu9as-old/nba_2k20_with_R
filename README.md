# working_with_R

In this project, I am showing you a dataset I have scraped from [2kRatings]() webpage, which deals with NBA 2K20 game and its NBA players stats. 

The script I wrote for the web-scraping is **nba2k20-scraping.py**.

This dataset contains more than 1000 different players and 60 columns which contain different information about all these players. I explain some characteristics of this dataset in [nba-2k20-ratings.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/edu9as-old/working_with_R/blob/master/nba-2k20-ratings.html) file. 

Finally, I have deployed a simple [Shiny app](https://edu9as.shinyapps.io/basedatasets/) to allow a dynamic exploration of the distribution of values in each numerical variable. 

I hope you enjoy this project!
